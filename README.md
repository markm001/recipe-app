# Recipe Application

A simple Webapplication utilising Angular for creating/saving and retrieving recipes, saving to a shopping List and creating an account as well as loggin in.
This Project currently uses a Firebase Backend and is merely meant for learning the basics of Angular and TypeScript.
It may be expanded with my own Backend Solution in the future, similar to the Scheduler Application.

The App can be found via: [Firebase Hosting](https://ng-recipe-app-f3b76.web.app/)
